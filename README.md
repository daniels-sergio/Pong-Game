When the ball hits the left or right wall the score of the respective player will increase.

Everytime a paddle touches the ball the balls speed will increase,making the games pace faster and maintaing tension.

Players cannot move the paddles simulataneously,In other words,trying to control both paddles at the same time is not possible.
Once the ball bounces off the paddle then only start moving the other paddle for the best chance of continuing the game.



Left paddle controls:

hold or press w o move the left paddle up

hold or press s to move the left paddle down

Right paddle controls:

hold or press the up arrow key o move the right paddle up

hold or press the down arrow key to move the right paddle down


Note:

If the ball touches the upper segment ofthe paddle it will result in the ball acting weirdly and ricochet multiple times off the paddle. So always try to let the ball make direct contact with the paddles longer side
